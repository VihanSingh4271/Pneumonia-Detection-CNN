Pneumonia, a type of dangerous lung infection among which especially children and seniors are in high risk. Early detection and timely intervention is the key for the successful management of pneumonia anomalies during early lung stages. This approach considerably raises the odds of survival. A special design of convolutional neural networks that is customized for medical chest images aims to detect instances of pneumonia infection. The obtained tracking performance is notably excellent, having an accuracy of up to 94.86% as well. Additionally, the model demonstrated good recall performance, which means a considerable number of true positives were correctly identified.
